  Team Profile Generator

  ## Description:
  In this project I was tasked with building a Node.js command line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries of each person given the following criteria:
* When prompted for team members and their information, then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
* When the user clicks on an email address in the HTML, then the default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
* When clicking on the GitHub username, then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
* When the application starts, then the user will be prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
* When the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number is entered, then the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern    or to finish building the team.
* If selecting the engineer option, then the user will be prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and user will be taken back to the menu.
* If selecting the intern option, then the user will be prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, then taken back to the menu.
When the user decides to finish building their team, then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
